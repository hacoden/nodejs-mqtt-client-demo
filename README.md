# Getting Started

## Step 1: Get prerequisites

You are going to need following tools:

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)

You can verify your installation by running the following in a Terminal window:

> $ git --version
> git version 2.17.1
> $ node -v
> v10.4.1
> $ npm -v
> 6.1.0

## Step 2: Download Sample Project

We have provided a simple sample to get you started. In the Terminal window run following command to clone the sample repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/wiihey/nodejs-mqtt-client-demo.git`

## Build and Run

Change to the directory that holds the sample:

`cp nodejs-mqtt-client-demo`

You need to install the dependencies to build the sample. Run the following command:

`npm install`

Wait for a while. Once it is finished, you can run the app:

`node src/index.js`

When the app starts, it displays `WiiHey DaaS Client Started` in the terminal window.
